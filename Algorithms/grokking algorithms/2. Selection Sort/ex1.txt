Suppose you’re building an app for restaurants to take customer orders. Your app needs to store a list of orders. Servers keep adding orders to this list, and chefs take orders off the list and make them. It’s an order queue: servers add orders to the back of the queue, and the chef takes the first order off the queue and cooks it.

solution:

Since the cheff has to be good at taking orders as supposed to delivering them, Linkedlist is efficient in this case. Because the app would need to be efficient at taking orders than at delivering them.
