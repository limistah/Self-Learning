Introduction to algorithm

Algorithms must be fast and correct.

Big O: Specifies the amount of operations that an algorithm requires.

It is also measures the worst case scenario of an algorithm

For example, considering a basic search that goes through all the elements in a list when making a search, which is O(n), suppose the search is for the first item, the result is (1) time - which is the best case scenario. 

Big O doesn't take into consideration, the best case scenario, rather it considers what if the element we are searching for is at the end of the list, what would be the runtime for the algorithm.
