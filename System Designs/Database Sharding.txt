Databaase optmization Options

- Scaling up Horizontally
- Add replicas - Introduces eventual consistency (the time it takes for data to be copied from the master to the read replicas)
- Sharding
Sharing data across multiple database servers.

In DB designs, Consistency trumps Availability

Consistent Hashing - Memcached can do this

Pros
- Scalability
- Availability
- Fualt Tolerance

Cons
- Complexity (Partition Mapping, Ruting, Non-uniformity, Resharding)
- Non performant on analytic queries - Perform the query, analyze the query, aggregate the query
